After receiving my DPhil from the University of Oxford under the supervision of [John March-Russell](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/march-russell), I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Notre Dame](https://physics.nd.edu/research/research-areas/elementary-particle-physics-high-energy-physics/).  I moved to Chicago to take up a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 2015, where I  am currently an Assistant Professor.  I live with my [Family](https://jamesunwin.github.io/family/) in downtown Chicago. 

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, in connection with physics beyond the Standard Model. I have previously written on a diverse range of topics including supersymmetric models, collider physics, astrophysics, and string phenomenology.  Much of my recent work has focused on dark matter and astroparticle physics, since is an area with a plentitude of recent and forthcoming experimental data. I also conduct a sideline of interdisciplinary research approached from an applied mathematics perspective.
