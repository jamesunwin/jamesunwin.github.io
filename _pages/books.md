## [Reaching for the stars (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737058472/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_4P5WBNZJMAVM0E3M977K?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

 
During the 2021 pandemic I wrote his a children's book titled  <b>Reaching for the Stars</b> , illustrated by mathematician [Maylis Limouzineau](https://lucky8locke.ultra-book.com/). It is a sweet story about a cat that goes through several transformations on their journey to become a star in the sky. Children and adults will love to read and reread this beautiful illustrated tale featuring Cats, Tigers, Zebras and Reindeer.

My wife  [Laura Schaposnik](http://lauraschaposnik.com/) translated the book to Spanish preserving both the message and the rhymes, making the book available in Spanish and English, as well as in a bilingual version.

See also my wife  [Laura Schaposnik's](http://lauraschaposnik.com/) children's books about Ene the curious little mouse who explores magic places. Through the adventures of Ene, I hope to teach bilingual words (Spanish-English) on different topics.
