   abstract={Restoration of the electroweak symmetry at temperatures around the Higgs mass is linked to tight phenomenological constraints on many baryogenesis scenarios. A potential remedy can be found in mechanisms of electroweak symmetry non-restoration (SNR), in which symmetry breaking is extended to higher temperatures due to new states with couplings to the Standard Model. Here we show that, in the presence of a second Higgs doublet, SNR can be realized with only a handful of new fermions which can be identified as viable dark matter candidates consistent with all current observational constraints. The competing requirements on this class of models allow for SNR at temperatures up to ∼TeV, and imply the presence of sub-TeV new physics with sizable interactions with the Standard Model. As a result this scenario is highly testable with signals in reach of next-generation collider and dark matter direct detection experiments.},

   abstract={In models of Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) the relic density is set by a particle asymmetry in an analogous manner to the baryons. Here we explore the scenario in which ADM decouples from the Standard Model thermal bath during an early period of matter domination. We first present a model independent analysis for a generic ADM candidate with s-wave annihilation cross section with fairly general assumptions regarding the origin of the early matter dominated period. We contrast our results to those from conventional ADM models which assume radiation domination during decoupling. Subsequently, we examine an explicit example of this scenario in the context of an elegant SO(10) implementation of ADM in which the matter dominated era is due to a long lived heavy right-handed neutrino. In the concluding remarks we discuss the prospects for superheavy ADM in this setting.},

   abstract={It is commonly assumed that the energy density of the Universe was dominated by radiation between reheating after inflation and the onset of matter domination 54,000 years later. While the abundance of light elements indicates that the Universe was radiation dominated during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is scant evidence that the Universe was radiation dominated prior to BBN. It is therefore possible that the cosmological history was more complicated, with deviations from the standard radiation domination during the earliest epochs. Indeed, several interesting proposals regarding various topics such as the generation of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, or microhalos during a nonstandard expansion phase have been recently made. In this paper, we review various possible causes and consequences of deviations from radiation domination in the early Universe - taking place either before or after BBN - and the constraints on them, as they have been discussed in the literature during the recent years.},

   abstract={A notable feature of UV freeze-in is that the relic density is strongly dependent on the highest temperatures of the thermal bath, and a common assumption is that the relevant 'highest temperature' should be the reheating temperature after inflation TRH. However, the temperature of the thermal bath can be significantly higher in certain scenarios, reaching a value denoted T max , a fact which is only apparent away from the instantaneous decay approximation. Interestingly, it has been shown that if the operators are of sufficiently high mass dimension then the dark matter abundance can be enhanced by a 'boost factor' depending on (Tmax/TRH) relative to naive estimates assuming instantaneous reheating. We highlight here that in non-standard cosmological histories the critical mass dimension of the operator above at which the instantaneous decay approximation breaks down, and the exponent of the boost factor, depend on the equation of state ω prior to reheating. We highlight four examples in which the dark matter abundance receives a significant enhancement in the context of gravitino dark matter, the moduli portal, the Higgs portal, and the spin-2 portal (as might arise in bimetric gravity models). We comment on the transition from kination domination to radiation domination as a motivated example of non-standard cosmologies.},

   abstract={If the early universe is dominated by an energy density which evolves other than radiation-like the normal Hubble-temperature relation H∝T^2 is broken and dark matter relic density calculations in this era can be significantly different. We first highlight that for a population of states ϕ sourcing an initial expansion rate of the form H∝T^{2+n/2} for n≥−4, during the period of appreciable ϕ decays the evolution transitions to H∝T^4. The decays of ϕ imply a source of entropy production in the thermal bath which alters the Boltzmann equations and impacts the dark matter relic abundance. We show that the form of the initial expansion rate leaves a lasting imprint on relic densities established while H∝T^4 since the value of the exponent n changes the temperature evolution of the thermal bath. In particular, a dark matter relic density set via freeze-in or non-thermal production is highly sensitive to the temperature dependance of the initial expansion rate. This work generalises earlier studies which assumed initial expansion rates due to matter or kination domination.},

   abstract={We study models in which the inflaton is coupled to two otherwise decoupled sectors, and the effect of preheating and related processes on their energy densities during the evolution of the universe. Over most of parameter space, preheating is not disrupted by the presence of extra sectors, and even comparatively weakly coupled sectors can get an order 1 fraction of the total energy at this time. If two sectors are both preheated, the high number densities could also lead to inflaton mediated thermalisation. If only one sector is preheated, Bose enhancement of the late time inflaton decays may cause significant deviations from the perturbative prediction for their relative reheat temperatures. Meanwhile, in Non-Oscillatory inflation models resonant effects can result in exponentially large final temperature differences between sectors that have similar couplings to the inflaton. Asymmetric reheating is potentially relevant for a range of beyond the Standard Model physics scenarios. We show that in dark matter freeze-in models, hidden sector temperatures a factor of 10 below that of the visible sector are typically needed for the relic abundance to be set solely by freeze-in dynamics.},

In fact, late time entropy jumps are usually required in models of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, which typically produces an initial particle-antiparticle asymmetry that is much too large. An important consequence of late time dilution, is that a smaller dark matter annihilation cross section is needed to obtain the observed dark matter relic density. For cosmologies with high scale baryogenesis, followed by radiation-dominated dark matter freeze-out, we show that the perturbative unitarity mass bound on thermal relic dark matter is relaxed to 10^10 GeV.

While in conventional dark matter scenarios, such sub-keV thermal dark matter would be excluded by free streaming bounds, the constraints are ameliorated in models with dark matter at lower temperature than conventional thermal scenarios, such as the Flooded Dark Matter model that we have previously considered. Modifying the arguments of Tremaine and Gunn we derive a conservative lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter of 70 eV and a stronger lower bound from Lyman-α clouds of about 470 eV, leading to slightly smaller cores than have been observed.

Anomaly cancellation typically requires the presence of new coloured and charged chiral fermions, and we argue that in a large class of models masses of these new states are expected to be comparable to that of the axial vector. Finally, an axial vector mediator could provide a portal between SM and hidden sector states, and we also consider the possibility that the axial vector couples to dark matter.

   abstract={Most dark matter (DM) models set the DM relic density by some interaction with Standard Model particles. Such models generally assume the existence of Standard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later consequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that DM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is generated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not necessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially leads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by the late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM relic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would take for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call Flooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is that DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most natural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the decaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling and hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter content of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We also show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector, relaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the implications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has interesting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and baryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump. Alternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis implementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time reheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of a lepton asymmetry.},

We introduce reference models describing dark matter annihilation to pairs of these new mediators, which decouples the SM-mediator coupling from the thermal annihilation cross section and easily explains the lack of direct detection signals. We determine the parameter regions that give good descriptions of the gamma ray excess for several motivated choices of mediator couplings to the SM. We find fermion dark matter with mass 7-26 GeV and a dark vector mediator, or scalar dark matter in the 10-50 GeV range (Higgs portal mediator) or 10-65 GeV range (gluophilic mediator) can provide a comparable or improved fit, compared to the case of direct annihilation.

   abstract={F-theory GUTs provide a promising UV completion for models with approximate gauge coupling unification, such as the (non-supersymmetric) Standard Model. More specifically, if the superparters have masses well above the TeV scale, the resulting imperfection in unification can be accounted for by the, in principle calculable, classical F-theory correction at the high scale. In this paper we argue for the correct form of the F-theory corrections to unification, including KK mode loop effects. However, the price of compensating the imprecise unification in such High Scale SUSY models with F-theory corrections is that the GUT scale is lowered, potentially leading to a dangerously high proton decay rate from dimension-6 operators. We analyse the possibility of suppressing the decay rate by the localization of X,Y gauge bosons in higher dimensions. While this effect can be very strong for the zero modes, we find that in the simplest models of this type it is difficult to realize a significant suppression for higher modes (Landau levels). Notably, in the absence of substantial suppressions to the proton decay rate, the superpartners must be lighter than 100 TeV to satisfy proton decay constraints. We highlight that multiple correlated signals of proton decay could verify this scenario.},

If R-parity is only mildly violated then the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) can be stable over cosmologically time-scales and still account for the dark matter relic density. We examine the possibility of generating detectable X-ray lines from R-parity violating decays of keV-scale LSP dark matter to neutrino-photon pairs. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which the LSP is a light gravitino, bino, or hidden sector photino. Potential signals are discussed in the context of recent claims of an unidentified 3.5 keV X-ray line in studies of stacked galaxy clusters. We comment on the difficulties in obtaining the observed relic density for keV scale bino or hidden photino dark matter and some possible resolutions.},

We investigate a new class of models in which a symmetric DM component, in the `low-mass' 1-10 GeV regime favoured for linking the DM and baryon asymmetries, is repopulated through decays. We find that, in models without significant velocity dependence of the annihilation cross section, observational constraints generally force these decays to be (cosmologically) slow. These late decays can give rise to gamma-ray signal morphologies differing from usual annihilation profiles. A distinctive feature of such models is that signals may be absent from dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

   abstract={This thesis is dedicated to the study of a prominent class of dark matter (DM) models, in which the DM relic density is linked to the baryon asymmetry, often referred to as Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) theories. In ADM the relic density is set by a particle-antiparticle asymmetry, in direct analogue to the baryons. This is partly motivated by the observed proximity of the baryon and DM relic densities Ω_{DM} ≈ 5 Ω_{B}, as this can be explained if the DM and baryon asymmetries are linked. A general requisite of models of ADM is that the vast majority of the symmetric component of the DM number density, the DM-antiDM pairs, must be removed for the asymmetry to set the DM relic density and thus to explain the coincidence of Ω_{DM} and Ω_{B}. However we shall argue that demanding the efficient annihilation of the symmetric component leads to a tension with experimental constraints in a large class of models.

   In order to satisfy the limits coming from direct detection and colliders searches, it is almost certainly required that the DM be part of a richer hidden sector of interacting states. Subsequently, examples of such extended hidden sectors are constructed and studied, in particular we highlight that the presence of light pseudoscalars can greatly aid in alleviating the experimental bounds and are well motivated from a theoretical stance. Finally, we highlight that self-conjugate DM can be generated from hidden sector particle asymmetries, which can lead to distinct phenomenology. Further, this variant on the ADM scenario can circumvent some of the leading constraints.},

In contrast to asymmetric dark matter models, the dark matter can be a real scalar or Majorana fermion and thus presents distinct phenomenology.

If Majorana masses are forbidden by an R-symmetry and the main source of electroweak gaugino masses are Dirac terms, then the Higgs quartic coupling vanishing at the SUSY scale and the Higgs boson mass will be near 125 GeV. Moreover, using an R-symmetry, models with only one Higgs doublet in the UV can be constructed and we argue that, since we desire only a single Higgs at the weak scale, this scenario is more aesthetic than existing models. We subsequently present a model which draws on both of these features. We comment on neutrino masses and dark matter in these scenarios and discuss how the models presented can be discerned from alternative constructions with high scale SUSY, including Split SUSY.},

   abstract={It is challenging to explain the tentative 125 GeV Higgs signal in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) without introducing excessive fine-tuning, and this motivates the study of non-minimal implementations of low energy supersymmetry (SUSY). A term \lambda SH_uH_d involving a Standard Model (SM) singlet state S leads to an additional source for the quartic interaction raising the mass of the lightest SM-like Higgs. However, in order to achieve m_h \approx 125 GeV with light stops and small stop mixing, it is necessary for \lambda \gtrsim 0.7 and consequently \lambda may become non-perturbative before the unification scale. Moreover, as argued by Barbieri, Hall, et al. low fine-tuning prefers the region \lambda~1-2, leading to new or non-perturbative physics involving S below the GUT scale (`\lambda SUSY' models). This raises the concern that precision gauge coupling unification, the prime piece of indirect experimental evidence for low energy SUSY, may be upset. Using the NSVZ exact \beta-function along with well motivated assumptions on the strong coupling dynamics we show that this is not necessarily the case, but rather there exist classes of UV completions where the strong-coupling effects can naturally correct for the present ~3% discrepancy in the two-loop MSSM unification prediction for \alpha_s. Moreover, we argue that in certain scenarios a period of strong coupling can also be beneficial for t-b unification, while maintaining the small to moderate values of tan\beta preferred by the Higgs mass.},
